# Binance Options Aggregator

This is a public module of a larger microservices trading intelligence platform. It collects and aggregates data from Binance Options markets to support quantitative trading strategies and decision-making.

## What It Does

- Fetches live and historical data from Binance Options.
- Runs aggregation pipelines (IV curves, volume spreads, strikes, etc.) using **GitHub Actions** on a schedule.
- Caches processed data in **GitHub Artifacts** for fast retrieval.
- Publishes data snapshots via HTTP for use in frontend dashboards or downstream services.
- Includes a dedicated frontend for data visualization built with **Observable notebooks** using [Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot) and **D3.js**.

## How It Works

- GitHub Actions automate the entire aggregation pipeline.
- Output is stored in GitHub Artifacts and published to a static `cdn` branch (e.g. via GitHub Pages).
- The frontend consumes this data and presents insights like IV surfaces, OI skews, strike distribution, etc.

## Frontend (Observable)

The frontend dashboard is powered by Observable notebooks:
- Written in Observable JavaScript.
- Uses `Plot` and `D3` to create interactive, dynamic visualizations.
- Connects directly to the latest aggregated data via CDN.
